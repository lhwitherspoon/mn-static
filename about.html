                    <h2>Update: as of March 2019 I am no longer in practice.</h2>
                    <p>I’m Les Witherspoon ND, a licensed naturopathic physician providing care to a diverse group of
                        individuals from around the Puget Sound area. I have strong interests in LGBTQ health and
                        transgender medicine; depression, anxiety and insomnia; fibromyalgia and hypermobility joint
                        syndrome. I enjoy working with neurodiverse individuals who are on the autism spectrum, have
                        Asperger Syndrome, or deal with ADHD. My practice is not limited to those groups and conditions,
                        however. I provide general and primary care for a wide range of people and conditions.</p>
                    <p>I (and Meditrinalia Naturopathic as a business) do not discriminate based upon race, religion,
                        dis/ability, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identification or lack thereof,
                        family/household configuration, neurotypical or neurodiverse status, or political beliefs. My aim is
                        to provide competent care that is also culturally sensitive.</p>
                    <p>I focus on offering “help without the hype”. The goal isn’t to be 100% natural. It’s to be
                        functional, and to live a life that is as optimal as possible for that person. Even when someone has
                        a chronic or incurable condition, in my belief there is almost always something that can be done to
                        to help them live their lives as fully as is possible for that individual.</p>
                    <p>My undergraduate degree was in chemistry (mathematics minor) with some graduate biochemistry study. I
                        therefore prefer treatments and approaches that have a reasonable basis in current scientific
                        thinking.</p>
                    <p>To obtain my degree as a doctor of naturopathic medicine at Bastyr University: I put in five more
                        years and over 4400 hours. My raining has included (but was not limited to):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>working with transgender patients at Verbena/Spectrum (a clinic located a Country Doctor), as
                            well as additional training with a provider working with transgender individuals. I continue to
                            obtain additional training in this area.</li>
                        <li>Shifts focusing on patients with ADHD, depression, cancer, and elders dealing with multiple
                            conditions.</li>
                        <li>Working with urban underserved patients at Carolyn Downs Community Clinic. In my practice I
                            continue to work with urban underserved populations.</li>
                        <li>I have continued to take additional training in providing primary care that incorporates
                            integrative health with conventional evidence-based standards of care, including attending CEUs
                            offered for nurse practitioners.</li>
                        <li>I’ve continued to obtain additional training in working with depression and anxiety, in working
                            with older adults and with adolescents, and in the basics of medication management for mental
                            health conditions.</li>
                        <li>I have additional interests and training in CBT-I (cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia),
                            and in botanical medicine formulation for digestive and respiratory conditions.</li>
    
                    </ul>
                    <p>I am also adjunct clinical faculty at Bastyr Center for Natural Health, where I supervise teaching
                        shifts on two days of the week. (As of March 2019 I am no longer adjunct clinical faculty at Bastyr
                        Center for Natural Health).</p>
                    <p>I’m a member of the Washington Association of Naturopathic Physicians, the Naturopathic Academy of
                        Primary Care Physicians, and the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association. When I’m not at the office, I
                        enjoy debating current affairs and tech with all and sundry, cooking dinner with my partner, raising
                        our kids, and trying to keep up with my ever-expanding booklist. I also have an interest in how
                        technology can help improve healthcare delivery for both patients and the providers who serve them.
